## 📋 Project Overview

Conducted a comprehensive internal security audit for Botium Toys, a fictional small U.S. business expanding internationally. The audit assessed current security controls and compliance posture using the NIST Cybersecurity Framework to identify critical security gaps and provide actionable remediation recommendations.

### Key Objectives
- Evaluate existing security controls and identify gaps
- Assess compliance with PCI DSS, GDPR, and SOC standards
- Provide risk-based recommendations for security improvements
- Create a roadmap for enhanced security posture

## 🎯 Key Findings

- **Overall Risk Score:** 8/10 (High Risk)
- **Critical Security Gaps:** Access controls, encryption, disaster recovery
- **Compliance Status:** Non-compliant with major frameworks
- **Immediate Action Required:** 4 critical controls missing

### Executive Summary
The audit revealed significant security vulnerabilities stemming from inadequate access controls and missing data protection measures. All employees currently have access to sensitive customer data, including credit card information, with no encryption in place. The absence of disaster recovery plans and data backups poses substantial business continuity risks.

## 📊 Controls Assessment Results

| Security Control | Status | Priority Level |
|------------------|---------|---------------|
| ❌ Least Privilege | Missing | Critical |
| ❌ Disaster Recovery Plans | Missing | Critical |
| ⚠️ Password Policies | Weak Implementation | High |
| ❌ Separation of Duties | Missing | Critical |
| ✅ Firewall | Present | - |
| ❌ Intrusion Detection System | Missing | High |
| ❌ Data Backups | Missing | Critical |
| ✅ Antivirus Software | Present | - |
| ✅ Legacy System Monitoring | Present | Medium |
| ❌ Encryption | Missing | Critical |
| ❌ Password Management System | Missing | High |
| ✅ Physical Locks | Present | - |
| ✅ CCTV Surveillance | Present | - |
| ✅ Fire Detection/Prevention | Present | - |

**Summary:** 6/14 controls adequately implemented | 8 controls require immediate attention

## 🔒 Compliance Assessment

### Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS)
**Status: ❌ Non-Compliant**
- ❌ Unauthorized access to credit card data
- ❌ Insecure payment processing environment
- ❌ No encryption for cardholder data
- ❌ Inadequate password management

### General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)  
**Status: ⚠️ Partially Compliant**
- ✅ 72-hour breach notification plan exists
- ✅ Privacy policies and procedures in place
- ❌ EU customer data not properly secured
- ❌ Data classification and inventory missing

### System and Organizations Controls (SOC Type 1/2)
**Status: ❌ Non-Compliant**
- ❌ No established user access policies
- ❌ Sensitive data (PII/SPII) not protected
- ✅ Data integrity measures present
- ❌ Inadequate access authorization controls

## 🛠️ Strategic Recommendations

### 🔴 Phase 1: Critical Security Foundation (0-30 days)
1. **Implement Least Privilege Access Controls**
   - Restrict employee access to only necessary data
   - Create role-based access control (RBAC) system
   
2. **Deploy Data Encryption**
   - Encrypt all customer credit card data
   - Implement encryption for data at rest and in transit
   
3. **Establish Disaster Recovery & Backup Systems**
   - Create comprehensive backup strategy
   - Develop business continuity plans
   
4. **Install Intrusion Detection System (IDS)**
   - Monitor network for suspicious activity
   - Set up automated alert mechanisms

### 🟡 Phase 2: Policy & Process Enhancement (30-90 days)
1. **Deploy Centralized Password Management**
   - Implement enterprise password manager
   - Enforce strong password complexity requirements
   
2. **Establish Separation of Duties**
   - Create checks and balances for critical operations
   - Implement approval workflows for sensitive tasks

3. **Formalize Legacy System Management**
   - Create maintenance schedules and procedures
   - Document intervention methods

### 🟢 Phase 3: Continuous Improvement (90+ days)
1. **Complete Asset Inventory & Classification**
2. **Implement Security Awareness Training**
3. **Establish Regular Security Assessment Schedule**

## 📈 Expected Impact

### Risk Reduction
- **Current Risk Score:** 8/10 (High)
- **Projected Risk Score:** 3/10 (Low) after full implementation
- **Timeline:** 6-month complete remediation

### Business Benefits
- ✅ Achieve full PCI DSS, GDPR, and SOC compliance
- ✅ Enable secure international expansion
- ✅ Protect against potential regulatory fines ($100K+ annually)
- ✅ Improve customer trust and data protection
